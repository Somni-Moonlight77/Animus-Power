<strong>In this story, Somni Moonlight is a fifteen-year-old scavenger, with the dragon name ‘Whisper’, who attends Jade Mountain Academy. He discovers he is an animus. The events of this occur before animus magic is broken. THE USER SOMNI MOONLIGHT DOES NOT OWN THE STATUS 'ANIMUS" ON WORLD OF JADE MOUNTAIN. THIS STORY IS USED PURELY FOR LETTER ROLEPLAYS.</strong> <br><br>
Somni sat at his desk in his dormitory-slash-cave. He opened a drawer and proceeded to pull out his various writing tools- his quill with its black ink, a blank scroll, and a few smooth rocks he found at the river. He loved to write, but more than that, he loved to write with old-fashioned instruments. It made him feel fancy, and it made the writing process seem more genuine. That was what was important, for writing poetry- his preferred genre of writing- required a state of mind, it required being ‘in the zone’, one might say. He was even wearing formal clothing, despite there being no one who he would see. Somni wore a light pair of khakis, leather brown loafers, a white button-up, and a dark tan textured blazer. <br> <br> 
Placing his smooth stones on the corners of the unfurled scroll, Somni slowly placed his hands on the edge of the desk, closing his eyes. He did this every time he wrote, a silly little ritual that he liked to do to almost force himself to let his ideas flow. He calmed himself, took a deep breath, and opened his mouth slightly. He was the exact image of peace right now- free of worldly stress and troubles, a feeling only one other was familiar with at the Academy, as far as Somni knew. Nova. He remembered the last time he had seen her, when she said in response to a ‘truth’ among a game of Truth or Dare with friends, that she would swap her life with his so that he would have her life, and she could take the burden of his past. <br> <br> 
An odd feeling swept through Somni right then, a feeling not quite like power, but maybe like potential energy coiled and ready to make that switch to moving kinetic energy. Somni’s reaction to him was like he was swelling, like his consciousness was reaching beyond his skull to feel the nature and energy of the world around him. He spoke the line, the ending of his ‘ritual’ before he would start writing. “Words of my mind, flow from me like rain from the clouds, and run perfectly and true to land on this page.” Exhaling, Somni opened his eyes, and he suddenly froze. A few lines that had popped into his head were being scrawled onto the blank scroll- but the quill was still, and the ink remained inside the well. “I once heard you say/ You would swap lives with/ Me so that I would have/Your life, and you could take /The burden of my past/ From my shoulders onto yours...”  <br> <br> 
Somni was shocked. He didn’t quite understand what was happening, or rather, he did but only in a frightening thought in the back of his head he didn’t want to allow to be true. As a test, he continued thinking down the path he had been in before he opened his eyes. More and more words and lines wrote themselves out onto the page until Somni’s train of thought ended, along with the poem. Somni just sat there, reading and re-reading the poem. It was the exact and perfect rendering of the ideas and thoughts that had been passing through Somni’s head. His earlier realization, in the back of his head, was in fact true. Somni was an animus. <br> <br> 
Somni stood up and paced the floor of his cave. His mind was a jumbled mess, where mental strands and cords twisted, turned, interlocked, twisted together and writhed in a tangled heap. He didn’t want to be an animus, it was too dangerous... with this power, he could cure sickness, stop disease... What would Nova think of him?... What would his parents think if they knew their son was capable of untold horrors? Somni stopped, suddenly. He knew animus power was something you are born with, and you don’t gain it. So, if he had known he was an animus that night his parents died, he might have kept them safe. Somni sank to his knees as his mind replayed that night. <br> <br> 
<I>It was chaotic outside. Trees whipped in the wind and branches crashed to the ground. Whisper followed his sister as she hurried to a metal door several yards from the house, set into the ground... His sister opened the door and told Whisper to go in. She followed him into the doorway, locking it behind her, and she groped in the darkness until she found a cylindrical object that put out light from one end. The light revealed a small stairway leading to a room down underground. The walls were thick metal. His sister sat down on the floor and told Whisper, “We just sit tight here now. Don’t worry. Mom and Dad should be here soon.”  <br> <br> 
By now, Whisper had an idea about what was happening. He had read something in a book, about a terrifying enemy that could not be fought, could only be hidden from until it passed. An enemy that that took and destroyed without mercy. “Moonsong?” His sister looked up at him. “Is there a tornado outside?” His sister looked up at him for a long moment before blowing out a breath and replying softly, “Yes.” Whisper shuddered and sat down next to his sister... <br> <br> 
Moonsong got up and paced the room for a minute. Finally, she stopped in front of Whisper. “Whisper, I need to go outside and find Mom and Dad. Stay here, and do not come out under any circumstance until you hear the wind and rain stop. I will be back with Mom and Dad.” Whisper got up quickly and started to protest before Moonsong told him, “I must do this. Don’t worry, I will be back.”  <br> <br> 
“But what if you don’t?” asked Whisper in a small voice. <br> <br> 
Moonsong sighed and put her hands on Whisper’s shoulders. “Little brother, I have a secret to tell you. I am scared. I don’t really know if I will return, but I want you to know I love you.” She pulled a pendant on a chain from her neck and put it on Whisper’s. The pendant was the shape of a crescent moon. “This necklace is a good luck charm, to remind you of my love. It will keep you safe. Remember how Hercules was brave and defeated the Nemean Lion, and then took its pelt and wore it as a cloak that protected him for the rest of his life? This pendant will just as surely keep you safe, as long as you do this one thing, and always do this one thing.” Whisper listened carefully and looked at his sister with wide, sad eyes. “You need to dream. No matter what you do, no matter what happens, never stop dreaming. And never stop chasing your dreams across the sky, to the moon. Now stay here and wait for me. Please.” Whisper closed his eyes and nodded. A tear trickled out of his eye, and he wiped it away quickly. He needed to be brave. He would be brave for his sister. <br> <br> 
Moonsong squeezed his shoulders one last time before walking out of the bunker, throwing her bag of life back into the bunker behind her. Whisper never heard back from her again.</i> <br> <br> 
Somni pulled himself out of the flashback, like he was turning off a horrible yet familiar film. He already knew what happened next. His young self would wait for his sister to return with their parents safe and sound, but they would never return. He would leave the bunker and put on one of his parents’ bags of life from when they attended Jade Mountain Academy, and he would fly and fly until he found his parents. He could still feel the evil flower of fear, misery, and grief spread its roots in the pit of his stomach as he saw the red on their black scales, the life that was missing from their eyes. Their fate that he now knew could have been stopped, by him. Somni shut his eyes tightly, and tried to slow the onslaught of tears, only partially succeeding. As a tear, then another and another slipped down Somni’s face, he felt something off. Something was missing... Somni sat bolt upright, his eyes spread as wide as his eyelids would allow as he realized something that he had somehow never thought about before: his sister, Moonsong. Her body wasn’t with their parents’. <br> <br> 
Moonsong! She could still be alive! Somni’s mind was reeling at the implications. She could still be alive, having lived off the forest and hunted for food... Somni had to slow himself down and prepare himself for the all-too-real possibility that Moonsong died that night as well.  <br> <br> 
Heart brimming with hope, Somni rose and returned to his desk. He pulled out another blank scroll and spread it on top of the poem. He chose his words carefully. “I enchant this scroll to show the answer to any question written upon it, then completely absorb the question and answer after they have been read so that there is no trace of either the question or the answer afterwards.” Somni added the last part so that more questions could be asked than would normally fit on the scroll. Picking up his quill pen, he dipped it in the ink and scratched out the question, “Is Moonsong, sister of Somni Whisper Moonlight, still living?” After a moment’s pause, one word appeared in black ink on the paper, as if it were ink rising from the depths of the ocean. ‘Yes’. <br> <br>
Somni leaned back in his chair, speechless. She was alive. His sister was alive. Somni still had family left. He leaned forward and wrote on the scroll, “Where exactly is Moonsong, sister of Somni Whisper Moonlight?” He waited, but no answer appeared on the scroll. Frowning, Somni re-wrote the question, but to the same result. He finally realized that the scroll probably could not show him the answer because it required a map, not words to explain. Somni placed his hand on the scroll and said, “I enchant this scroll to be able to answer questions in the same manner of the previous enchantment cast upon it, except that it may also show a map that will disappear after being seen and read if the question requires one to be answered.” Somni suddenly realized he had known he was an animus for less than an hour, and he had already cast three spells, including the one with the poem. He needed to create something that would keep him sane and keep him from turning evil as a result of his animus power. Somni thought for an item, and he reached under his shirt to his crescent moon necklace, given to him by his sister. He spoke clearly and carefully for his fourth enchantment:  <br> <br> 
“I enchant this necklace to keep Somni Whisper Moonlight from losing any of his soul to his animus magic or enchantments; And to keep Somni Whisper Moonlight from going insane as a result of his animus magic or enchantments; And to alert Somni Whisper Moonlight with a faint buzzing in his ears that would last three seconds whenever he is about to cast a spell or enchantment that he would decide is ‘wrong’ or ‘evil’ based on his moral judgement before he casted any animus spells or enchantments. I enchant this necklace to have all of these affects whether Somni Whisper Moonlight is wearing the necklace or not; and to continue to have these properties if it is damaged or destroyed; and to be impervious to all future enchantments from any animus other than Somni Whisper Moonlight, and to be impervious to all future enchantments from Somni Whisper Moonlight that he would consider ‘wrong’ or ‘evil’ based on his moral judgement before he casted any animus spells or enchantments.” <br> <br> 
With the enchantments made on the necklace, Somni tucked it back under his shirt, reassured now that the animus power might not be so bad as he originally thought. He returned his attention to the scroll, and he wrote, “Show me on a map where Moonsong, sister of Somni Whisper Moonlight, is at this very moment.” A map slowly appeared on the scroll, and a small black dot labeled ‘Moonsong, Sister of Somni Whisper Moonlight’ marked a spot on the north-east edge of the rainforest, bordering the Mud Kingdom. Somni let out a breath. There she was. He immediately got up and changed to a pair of cargo pants and a shirt that could get messed up and dirty. He paused for a moment, then. What if his sister thought of him as something horrible when she found out about his power? Somni shook his head to himself. It didn’t matter, he still needed to find her, despite how she might react when she found out. He then grabbed his bag of life and left his dormitory, and he practically flew down the hallways in his scavenger form to get to the exit from the mountain where dragons could land and take off. Throwing on his bag of life when he arrived, Somni winged towards the rainforest and the location of his sister.  <br> <br> 
... <br> <br> 
Somni was flying over the rainforest edge, where it bordered the marshes of the Mudwings. He studied the trees below him, looking for any sign of a dragon living there. As he was about to turn around and re-scan the area he had just flown over, he noticed an odd structure out of the corner of his eye. He dived down into the trees and landed outside the structure- it looked like a one or two room house made out of trees stacked on their sides. He called out hesitantly, “Hello? Is there anyone in there?” He did not turn into his scavenger form because he doubted his sister would be in hers, unless she somehow found a bag of life after he took both Mother’s and Father’s. Whisper, for ‘Whisper’ was his dragon name, was about to repeat the question as he walked around to the front of the log-house when the door creaked partway open. A wary black snout poked out of the structure, and the dragon slowly pushed the door the rest of the way open, revealing their full self. Whisper tentatively asked, with shortness of breath, “Moonsong?” <br> <br> 
The dragon’s expression shifted from wariness to shock. “Whisper?” she responded in a quiet voice.  <br> <br> 
Somni bounded over to his sister in one large stride before flinging his wings around her. His voice was thick with emotion and tears; his sentences were only half audible. “I’m sorry... thought you were gone... saw Mom and Dad... I never looked for you... never should have...” <br> <br> 
At this point, his sister stopped him, and Whisper saw she was crying, too. “You have nothing to be sorry for, I was the one old enough to keep my wits, and I never should have given up looking because it was my responsibility to find you...” His sister paused. “Whisper... How did you find me?” She rushed on. “Not that I’m not overjoyed to see you, I was just wondering how you found me after all these years, it seems kind of odd, you know?”  <br> <br> 
Whisper took a breath and said, “I just found out earlier today, and please don’t think of me any different but... I’m... I’m an Animus.” He cringed slightly, not wanting to see his sister’s face when she found out he was a monster.  <br> <br> 
His sister didn’t yell. She didn’t run away screaming. She just sat down and sighed. “We wondered if you would be an Animus.” Whisper was stunned. “Y- you are okay with it? Aren’t you worried about the power? What if- what if I do something to you? Or to someone at the academy?” <br> <br> 
“No, why would I be?” came Moonsong’s reply. “I may not have been in your life for the last several years, but I do know you, and I know that you would never hurt anybody. You are the most loyal and protective person I have ever met.” When Whisper didn’t look convinced, his sister sighed again and said, “Did Mom and Dad ever tell you about our grandfather?”  <br> <br> 
A look of slight confusion crossed Whisper’s face before he shook his head. “They never mentioned the rest of the family.” Moonsong sighed. “I suppose I understand why. You see, our grandfather on Mom’s side was an Animus, too. The rest of the family shunned him, thinking the thoughts you are having about yourself. His daughter was the only person who took him for who he was, not just as a ‘vile Animus’. Mom and Dad probably didn’t feel comfortable for you to know or meet the rest of the family at such a young age, because of the intense prejudices the family had against Animi, and even possible animi.” Whisper grew more and more interested as his sister spoke. He had never known his grandfather was an Animus, and he was eager to learn about the dragon he inherited his power from. <br> <br> 
“Grandfather was a scientist, as well,” Moonsong continued. “He was the first animus in our bloodline, and he was curious as to how the power is inherited. He researched the Animus genes in his own blood, and he compared his data with that of past gene tests from historic Animi if I remember it correctly. He also used his animus power to do certain things- like seeing DNA in a larger, sharper image than you could ever achieve with a microscope. I don’t understand a lot of his findings, but I think his tests confirmed that Animus power is a recessive trait that is inherited from parent to child. He couldn’t explain how animus power comes into a bloodline when it has never been there before, though.”  <br> <br> 
Whisper felt close to his grandfather then. Both of them loved science, and it sounded that Grandfather had been a very successful scientist, as well. “Why do you tell me this?” Whisper asked, his voice hoarse with emotion. Moonsong looked into his eyes and replied, “I am telling you this because I want you to know that you are not a monster. Grandfather had the same power as you, and look what he used it for! He used it for good and for knowledge. He also had the foresight to enchant an item to protect his soul.” <br> <br>  
Whisper nodded and said quietly, “Yeah. I’ve already done that, too.” He pulled out his crescent moon pendant that Moonsong had given him that stormy day all those years ago. Her expression softened. “I didn’t know if you still had it. Now it can protect you in more ways than one.”  <br> <br> 
They were quiet for a moment before Whisper said, “I never stopped, you know. I never stopped dreaming, like you said.” His sister looked up, her damp eyes gazing into his. “I even made my scavenger name ‘Somni’ to remind myself,” continued Whisper, his eyes leaking slightly as well. “Somni means ‘dream’ in Latin.” <br> <br> 
“Oh, come here,” Moonsong said, and she wrapped her wings around Whisper. For a while they just stood like that. Then Moonsong said, “tell me about how you have been. What has happened since you went to the Academy?” And so, Whisper pulled away and began to tell her about his life. He told her about the friends he made, how he discovered he liked writing and loved poetry, and how he had once been the Study of Creatures Protégé before he resigned. “I also, um, have a girlfriend now. Her name is Nova.” said Whisper, and his sister snorted and hid her laughter poorly. “What!?” asked Whisper, surprised and a little incredulous. “Sorry, it’s just when you-” and then she dissolved into a fit of giggles again. “It’s just that when you said her name, your voice goes all wistful and sigh-y and you’re all starry-eyed,” Moonsong managed to get out. “My voice was NOT ‘sigh-y’, besides, that’s not even a word!” protested Whisper.   <br> <br> 
In a more serious tone, Whisper said quietly, “I still need to tell her I am an Animus. I came here as soon as I figured it out and found you.” Moonsong replied, “Go. Go tell her. I will be fine here, and you can always come back and visit me.” She added the last comment before Whisper could protest. Whisper threw his wings around her in an embrace one last time before soaring into the sky, in the direction of the Academy. <br> <br> 
… <br> <br> 
Somni was back in his scavenger form, and he was standing in front of Nova’s room at the Academy. Pausing with his fist about to knock on the door, Somni steeled his courage and knocked on the door. He knew he could trust her.  <br> <br> 
When she opened the door, Somni said, “I need to talk to you in my room, please.” Nova seemed to realize something was up, and she nodded and followed him to his cave. Somni locked the door behind them and walked over to the couch, sitting down. Sighing, Somni started without preamble, “I am an Animus.” He was about to continue, but he couldn’t seem to find the words. Nova sat down next to him and took his hand in hers. “When did you find out?” Her voice was soft and unaccusing. Somni responded, “Just earlier today. I was writing, and I accidentally cast a spell that caused the words to write themselves out as I would think them. I later casted a spell on my necklace to protect my soul.”  <br> <br> 
Nova was quiet for a moment before saying, “I can’t say this won’t take getting used to, but I promise I will support you no matter what. Can I hear the wording you used on your necklace?” Somni sighed with relief at Nova’s words. He squeezed her hand as he recited the enchantment in a manner that it would not cast the spell again. She nodded approvingly as he spoke. “That’s good. I don’t see anything that could be improved upon it. And I promise to help you with this, and to help you stay on the right moral track. That is, if you want that help...” Somni nodded at her implied question. “Yes, I would like that. Very much. There is also something else... My sister, Moonsong, she’s alive. She is actually alive. I found her with my magic, and I met her in the rainforest.”  <br> <br> 
Nova's eyes widened. “Woah... that’s amazing! It must feel great, knowing she is alive and well. At least, I take it she is well?” Somni nodded and smiled faintly. “I told her about you. Maybe you two could meet someday.” Nova nodded. “Yeah, I would love to.” He hugged her as he let out his final tears from the stress of the day, breathing in her distinct scent.  <br> <br> 
When he stopped crying, Somni was more relaxed. He suddenly remembered the poem he had written earlier. Standing up and fetching the scroll, he wordlessly handed it to Nova. She unfurled it and read it aloud, her lips curling upward the further she read. <br> <br> 
<i>“I once heard you say  <br> 
You would swap lives with  <br> 
Me so that I would have  <br>  
Your life, and you could take  <br> 
The burden of my past   <br> 
From my shoulders onto yours.  <br> <br> 
I have never heard someone say that,  <br> 
And I love that you are kind enough <br> 
To say such a thing, to wish such a thing,  <br> 
But if I never experienced my past pain,  <br> 
I never would have grown up so fast.  <br> 
I never would have seen how not to love someone right.  <br> 
You deserve to be loved by a person  <br> 
Who falls asleep with you on their mind, making them high <br> 
(Last night I fell asleep thinking of ways   <br> 
To adequately tell you your beauty)  <br> <br> 
You deserve to be loved by a person  <br> 
Who, bored, hears your name  <br> 
And snaps to attention like a dog  <br> 
Who hears the food can open  <br> 
(The only thing missing would have been my ears standing on end) <br> <br> 
If I never felt my pain,  <br> 
If I never had something important to say,  <br> 
I never would have learned how to write  <br> 
In a way that could show someone crazy how to be sane,  <br> 
I never would have been able to be <br> 
The person you deserve, the person who would say:  <br> <br> 
“Being with you gives me wings to fly,  <br> 
But I would forfeit angelhood  <br> 
Just to be on Earth with you until I die  <br> 
I haven’t yet seen you beating yourself up,   <br> 
But if you ever would, I know I truthfully could  <br> 
Tell you that you could cross paths with an atheist <br>  
Who would be led to believe in God just long enough to say,  <br> 
“God damn” because, and excuse me if I am being brash  <br> 
But these feelings turn everything else to ash,  <br> 
I love you in such a  <br> 
Deep, glassy calm ocean way,  <br> 
I just want to fall asleep and wake up with you by my side,  <br> 
But at the same time I want to kiss you with our shirts off  <br> 
Until we’re both dizzy and gasping for air,  <br> 
Because actions speak louder than words,  <br> 
 And I love you so much it hurts,  <br> 
And I want to tell you how much you mean to me,  <br> 
And I want to tell you that you are beautiful,  <br> 
And you, you deserve to know that  <br> 
I hope you know that.”" </i><br> <br> 
 Nova finished reading and rolled up the scroll before hugging Somni tightly, a slight glimmer of tears in her eyes. “I love you, too. I always will.” Somni relaxed completely in her arms. For the first time since discovering he was an Animus, he was without fear, because now he had the two most important people in his love there to help him. With Nova and Moonsong with him, he felt like he could take on the world, Animus powers or none.
